# GrokkingAlgorithms
This repository contains implementations of algorithms from the book
"Grokking Algorithms".
I really liked the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. 
However, all the examples in this book are written in python. 
It will be easier for beginner .Net developers if they work with examples on C#. 
This way they can immediately dive into the algorithms without trying to understand python.
